## Who are we?

We are a group of computer scientists whose research focuses on using Affective Computing methods in the field of Software Engineering. Our interests include, but are not limited to, the role of emotions in the software development process, reusing datasets from Affective Computing experiments as well as improving the teaching process of future software engineers.

## Collaboration
We are open to any kind of cooperation. Do you want to do research together? Prepare a paper? Submit a project proposal? If you are conducting research at the intersection of the fields of affective computing and software engineering feel free to contact us via email. Take a look at our current research and projects and get in touch!
